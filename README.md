- As a user, I want to be able to view all vehicles in the inventory, so that I can assess the available stock at any given time.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for vehicles by their price range, make & model, year, color, mileage, and type, so that I can quickly find vehicles within a budget.
- As a user, I want to be able to add new vehicles or remove an existing from the inventory, so that we can keep track of the vehicles we have for sale.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the changes dealership's inventory to a file, so that we can persist the data and retrieve it later.

## Future Work

- Implement a user authentication system for different levels of access.
- Enhance the search functionality to support more complex queries.
- Add a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
- Mobile Compatibility: Develop a mobile application or optimize the existing system for mobile devices to allow dealership staff to access the system on the go, enabling remote management of inventory and customer interactions.
- Vehicle Maintenance Tracking: Incorporate features for tracking vehicle maintenance schedules, service history, and warranty information. This would help ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and serviced, leading to better customer satisfaction and retention.
